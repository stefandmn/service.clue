for **Clue** and _kodi_ within media center environment. The addon might be 
used also as service add-on for a standalone _Kodi_ instance, providing APIs 
and common routines that might be used by other addons, like cron service with 
many builtin jobs for various tasks (like database updates, backup, restore, 
sync skin, etc.) and other useful operations.

requires the installation of `module.clue` addon with common Python libraries.

Configuration Management), built over GNU `make` utility. To see all make rules
